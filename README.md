# FLARE

**F**easibi**l**ity **A**nalysis **R**equest **E**xecutor

## Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a service that allows for execution of feasibility queries on a FHIR-server.

## Build

```sh
mvn clean install
```

## Run

```sh
docker-compose up
```

In order for flare to work, a FHIR server such as [Blaze](https://github.com/samply/blaze) must be running on port 8082 by default.

## Default Configuration

The default configuration assumes the following:

* there is about 8 GiB of memory available for Flare
  * 4 GiB JVM heap including 1 GiB in-memory Cache
  * about 1 GiB JVM off-heap memory especially for the disk-based cache
  * about 3 GiB for page cache and the rest of the operating system
* there is plenty of disk space
  * the disk space used by the disk-based cache is not constrained right now
  * cache entries life for at least 7 days per default
  * disk space is only reclaimed on a best-effort base
* the FHIR endpoint is capable of handling 4 requests in parallel
* the FHIR endpoint is capable of returning pages of size 1000 or constrain the page size itself

## Support for self-signed certificates

Flare supports the use of self-signed certificates from your own CAs.
On each startup FLARE will search through the folder /app/certs inside the container
, add all found CA *.pem files to a java truststore and start FLARE with this truststore.

In order to add your own CA files, add your own CA *.pem files to the /app/certs folder of the container.

Using docker-compose mount a folder from your host (e.g.: ./certs) to the /app/certs folder,
 add your *.pem files (one for each CA you would like to support) to the folder and ensure that they
have the .pem extension.
